All the plugins listed in the plugins.txt file are coming from the 
public repo for Jenkins plugins. The Red Hat internal plugin repos are
split into three locations, which can't be supported by the OpenShift/
Jenkins S2I code.

Plugins jms-messaging and redhat-ci-plugin are not available from the
public Jenkins repo, so have been copied here from the Red Hat internal
repo.

The Red Hat CI Plugin is available for download here:
  http://ci-ops-jenkins-update-site.rhev-ci-vms.eng.rdu2.redhat.com/update-center/redhat/

The JMS Messaging Plugin is available for download here:
  https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JMS+Messaging+Plugin

2018/01/30: Installed versions:
  Red Hat CI Plugin v1.5.1
  JMS Messaging Plugin v1.0.31
